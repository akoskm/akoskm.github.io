Being in direct contact with my clients definitely has its benefits. It helps us to build the mutual trust that is necessary in remote work environments. I enjoy transparent work and tend to initiate the next steps. Sometimes I’m overly excited about a project and missing the obvious signs that our professional relationship probably won’t last long. Recently I had a disturbing conference call, which could have been easily avoided, if I pay attention to the these warning signs. If you’re about to hire a freelancer for your next awesome project, don’t contact me if:

### 1. Your friend contacts me
Helping out a friend is a nice thing but unless you’re working in an environment where someone else is designated for contacting freelancers, please, just ask your friend that next time you would like to email me first. Definitely don’t let them telling me that you’re on vacation. Especially if later turns out that you’re actually sick. Remember, we’re trying to build mutual trust.

### 2. Telling me that freelancers already lied to you
Obviously you interviewed other people with different levels of experience. What’s the point of telling me that another freelancers lied about knowing a specific technology? Is that a sneaky strategy to threaten me so I’ll surely tell the truth? “They lied about knowing X”, what does that even mean? “Knowing X” means different things to different people. But above all, it’s irrelevant and it’s hurting your image.

### 3. Calling other freelancers by names
Because you’re actually talking about me. If I refuse to work with you, during your next interview I’ll be called by names.

### 4. Discussing the freelancer’s nationality, religion
This is just as pointless as 2. I’m a minority in my country. If that’s not enough explanation to a question I shouldn’t even have answered or you aren’t familiar with the term “minority” you probably shouldn’t go any further. Definitely don’t try to explain me who I am or where I am from.

### 5. Respecting each other’s time
I won’t hang up a conference call, it would be unprofessional, but there are “secret” signs indicating that our conversation is probably over. The fact that I just let you know that I’ll contact you as soon as I read the specifications doesn’t mean we should discuss other technologies, the weather or politics.

Anyone who wants to hire a freelancer: I didn’t sort this list by priority. Doing any of these won’t do any good for you or your company.

Freelancers: when the above list checks out before taking an assignment, try to arrange a quick conference call. Carefully listening to each other can reveal more things than you can possibly imagine. Saying no early is much easier than working with someone who doesn’t respect you.
