Realtime Raytracer, the acoustical design tool, is now in alpha! Check out the demo
[here](http://bp3dbt2d-env.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com) and the promo video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBA91hA2NEw).

One of the final steps before the alpha release was to improve the existing npm scripts to
produce files that are easier to debug and to create a compressed bundle which will be served to the client.

### blueprint3d scripts

The Realtime Raytracer is based on [blueprint3d](https://github.com/furnishup/blueprint3d).
In the beginning <code>package.json</code> contained only a single npm script which built the application without
any further minification or obfuscation:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "browserify src/blueprint3d.js > example/js/blueprint3d.js --verbose"
}
```

Because the previous command dumped everything into a single file, it was a bit uncomfortable for
debugging, especially when the application began to grow.

Speaking about size, trimming out the unnecessary characters from the source before delivering it to the client
was also a requirement. So the two main goals were:

* to have the ability of debugging separate files
* deliver a compressed, if possible 'uglified', final file to the client

### Debugging separate files

This was fairly easy, thanks to the built-in flag of [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#usage).
A quick googling might suggest that you could do it through [minifyify](https://github.com/ben-ng/minifyify).
But the source maps won't behave as you would expect and what could be easier than:

```
 --debug -d  Enable source maps that allow you to debug your files

             separately.
```

Adding this to the existing npm script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "browserify -d src/blueprint3d.js > example/js/blueprint3d.js --verbose"
}
```

made the original source files debuggable, separately, without any additional plugin.

### Production build

The final script is produced by minifyify (which internally uses
[uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)), because it creates smaller bundles then uglify-js itself.
The final bundle was 811 KB with uglify-js while with minifyify only 596 KB.

The command for doing a minifyify-ed build looks like:

```
browserify src/blueprint3d.js -p [minifyify --no-map] > example/js/blueprint3d.js
```

and here is the final set of scripts that is currently in use for production and development:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "browserify -d src/blueprint3d.js > example/js/blueprint3d.js --verbose"
  "prod": "browserify src/blueprint3d.js -p [minifyify --no-map] > example/js/blueprint3d.js"
}
```

If you want mangling, that's possible too. Specify any mangling options after <code>--mangle</code>:

```
browserify src/blueprint3d.js -p [minifyify --no-map --uglify [ --mangle [ 'toplevel' ] ] ] > example/js/blueprint3d.js
```

from [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#mangler-options).

If you would like to experiment further, there is a minimalistic application which uses these
scripts to generate development and production bundles: [browserify-example](https://github.com/akoskm/browserify-example).

Is there a better way to do this? Do you use something else? Feel free to leave a comment below!
